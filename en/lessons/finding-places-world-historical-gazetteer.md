## 1. Lesson Overview 
Researchers often need to be able to search a corpus of texts for a defined list of terms. In many cases, historians are interested in certain places named in a text or texts. This lesson details how to programmatically search documents for a list of terms, including place names. First, we produce a tab-separated value (TSV) file with a row for each occurrence of the term and an HTML file of the text with the terms highlighted. This visualization can be used to interpret the results and to assess their usefulness for a given project.  

In this lesson, readers will use the Python pathlib library to load a directory of text files. For those with an existing gazetteer or list of terms, readers will create a list of term matches and their locations in a text. For those without a gazetteer, users can use a statistical language model to identify places. Finally, users will create a TSV file in the Linked Places Format, which can then be uploaded to the [World-Historical Gazetteer](http://whgazetteer.org/) for reconciliation, geocoding, and basic mapping.

This lesson will be useful for anyone wishing to perform NER on a text corpus. Other users may wish to skip the text extraction portion of this lesson and focus solely on the spatial elements of the lesson, that is gazetteer building and using the World Historical Gazetteer. These spatial steps are especially useful for someone looking to create historical maps in a largely point and click interface. We have designed this lesson to show how to combine text analysis with spatial analysis, but understand that some readers may only be interested in one of these two methodologies. We urge you to try both parts of the lesson together if you have time to see how the two can be linked in one project and see how the results of these two parts can be ported into another form of digital analysis. 

Please note that the sample data and context of this lesson constitute an example of multilingual DH. The memoir texts are in German and the list of place names represented German transliterations of Russian names for places across the former Soviet Union circa 1941-1956.

## 2. Historical example
This lesson is an application of co-author Susan Grunewald's research and serves as a practical use-case of how and why these methods are beneficial to historians. Grunewald has worked to map forced labor camps of German POWs in the Soviet Union during and after the Second World War. The results of her mapping have shown that contrary to popular memory, German POWs in the Soviet Union were sent more commonly to industrial and reconstruction projects in Western Russia rather than Siberia. She then wanted to understand if POW memoirs gave a false misrepresentation of Siberian captivity, which could have helped to create or promulgate this popular memory.

In this lesson, we will use a list of camp names to identify mentions of camps and locations in POW memoirs. This data can then be mapped to demonstrate that not all direct place mentions in POW memoirs were in Siberia. Rather, the term "Siberia" served as a decorative term that framed POWs as victims who had endured harsh conditions and cruelty in an exoticized Soviet East.

## 3. Building a corpus
For the sake of this lesson, we have compiled a sample dataset of selections from digitized POW memoirs to search for place names. Due to copyright restrictions, these are not the full text of the memoirs but rather snippets from roughly 35 sources. [We have provided a sample textual corpus for download](place_texts.txt).

To build your own corpus for this exercise, all you need are files saved in .txt format. If you need help building a corpus of .txt files, see [this existing *Programming Historian* tutorial by Andrew Akhlaghi](https://programminghistorian.org/en/lessons/OCR-and-Machine-Translation) for instruction on how to turn PDF files into machine readable text files. 

## 4. Building a gazetteer
In short, a gazetteer is merely a list of place names. For our example, we are using information from [an encyclopedia about German prisoners of war camps](https://www.worldcat.org/title/orte-des-gewahrsams-von-deutschen-kriegsgefangenen-in-der-sowjetunion-1941-1956-findbuch/oclc/682052025&referer=brief_results) as attested in central Soviet government documents. This particular encyclopedia lists the nearest location (e.g. settlement or city) for each of the roughly 4,000 forced labor POW camps. 

As a quick side note, this encyclopedia is an interesting example of the many layers of languages involved in studying Soviet history. The original source book is in German, meaning it uses German transliteration standards for the Russian Cyrillic alphabet. Generally, the places named in the book represent the contemporary Soviet names. This means that the places might not be called that today or they might be Russified versions of places that are more commonly named in a different way due to post-Soviet identity politics. Finally, some of the place names may still have the same name, but as an added difficulty, the German transliteration is of a Russian transliteration of a local language, such as Armenian, providing extra layers of distortion to the later mapping process.

The gazetteer from this lesson also is an example of a historical gazetteer. That is, these names are those utilized by a particular regime during a specific historical context. Trying to map the places named in the memoirs from this case is not a simple task as the names have changed both in the Soviet and post-Soviet era. By using a resource such as the World Historical Gazetteer, it is possible to have the larger historical gazetteer system serve as a crosswalk between the historical and contemporary names, giving us the ability to easily map these historical locations on a modern map. This process is not foolproof with larger, common geographic information systems such as Google Maps or ArcGIS.

Users can build their own gazetteer simply by listing places of importance for their study in an Excel spreadsheet and saving the document as a comma-separated value (CSV) file. Note, for this lesson and the World Historical Gazetteer, it is best to only focus on the names of settlements (i.e. towns and cities). The World Historical Gazetteer does not currently support mapping and geolocating for states or countries at this point in time.

[We have provided a sample gazetteer of German names for prisoner of war camps](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/apjanco/PH_article/main/gazetteer.txt) for use with the rest of the steps of this lesson.

## 5. Finding Places in Text with Python
From your computer’s perspective, text is nothing more than a sequence of characters. If you ask Python to iterate over a snippet of text, you’ll see that it returns just one letter at a time. Note that the index starts at 0, not 1 and that spaces are part of the sequence. 

```python
text = "Siberia has many rivers."
for index, char in enumerate(text):
    print(index, char)
```
```
0  S
1  i
2  b
3  e
4  r
5  i
6  a
7  
8  h
9  a
10 s
11  
12 m
13 a
14 n
15 y
16  
17 r
18 i
19 v
20 e
21 r
22 s
23 .
```

When we ask Python to find the word “rivers,” in a larger text, it is actually searching for a lower-case “r” followed by “i” “v” and so on. It returns a match only if it finds exactly the right letters in the right order.  When it makes a match, Python’s .find() function will return the location of the first character in the sequence. For example:

```python
text = "Siberia has many rivers."
text.find("rivers")
```
```
17
```

Keep in mind that computers are very precise and picky.  Any messiness in the text will cause the word to be missed, so `text.find("Rivers")` returns -1, which means that the sequence could not be found. You can also accidentally match characters that are part of the sequence, but not part of a word.  Try `text.find("y riv")`.  You get 15 as the answer because that is the beginning of the “y riv” sequence, which is present in the text, but isn’t a thing that you’d normally want to find. 

## Natural language processing 

While pure Python is sufficient for many tasks, natural language processing (NLP) libraries allow us to work computationally with the text as language. NLP reveals a whole host of linguistic attributes of the text that can be used for analysis.  For example, the machine will know if a word is a noun or a verb with part of speech tagging. We can find the direct object of a verb to determine who is speaking and the subject of that speech.  NLP gives your programs an instant boost of information that opens new forms of analysis. As a historian, I also appreciate how NLP makes me consider the linguistic aspects of my sources in ways that I otherwise might not.    

Our first NLP task is tokenization. This is where our text is split into meaningful parts, usually word tokens. The sentence, “Siberia has many rivers.” can be split into the tokens: `<Siberia><has><many><rivers><.>`.  Note that the ending punctuation is now distinct from the word rivers. The rules for tokenization depend on the language you are using. For English and other languages with spaces between words, you often get good results simply by splitting the tokens on spaces. However, a host of rules are often needed to separate punctuation from a token, to split and normalize words (ex. "Let's" > Let us) as well as specific exceptions that don't follow regular patterns. 

For this lesson, we’ll be using an NLP library called [spaCy](https://spacy.io/). This library focuses on “practical NLP” and is designed to be fast, simple and works well on a basic laptop.  For these reasons, spaCy can be a good choice for historical research tasks. As a library, spaCy is opinionated and simplicity comes at the cost of choices being made on your behalf. As you learn more about NLP, the [spaCy documentation](https://spacy.io/) is a good place to learn about their design choices and to assess whether it's the best solution for your particular project.  That said, spaCy works extrelemy well for tasks such as tokenization, part-of-speech tagging and named entity recognition (NER). Similar libraries, such as [NLTK](https://www.nltk.org/), [CLTK](http://cltk.org/) or [Stanza](https://stanfordnlp.github.io/stanza/ner.html) are also excellent choices and you can learn a lot by comparing the different approaches these libraries take to similar problems.  

Once you’ve run `pip install spacy` [(see the *Programming Historian* article "Installing Python Modules with pip" by Fred Gibbs if you’re new to pip)](https://programminghistorian.org/en/lessons/installing-python-modules-pip), you can now import the object for your language that will have the tokenization rules specific to your language. The [spaCy documentation](https://spacy.io/usage/models/#languages) lists the currently supported languages and their language codes.

To load the language, you will import it. For example, `from spacy.lang.de import German` or `from spacy.lang.en import English` 
In Python, this line goes to spaCy's directory, then into the subfolders `lang` and `de` to import the Language object called German from that folder.

We are now able to tokenize our text with the following:
```python
from spacy.lang.de import German
nlp = German()
doc = nlp("Berlin ist eine Stadt in Deutschland.")
for token in doc:
    print(token.i, token.text) 
```
```    
0 Berlin
1 ist
2 eine
3 Stadt
4 in
5 Deutschland
6 .
```
Note that each token now has its own index.

With the language object we can tokenize the text, remove stop words and punctuation, and many other common text processing tasks.  For further information, Ines Montani has created an excellent free [online course](https://course.spacy.io/en/).

## Load the gazetteer 

Now let’s focus back on the task at hand. We need to load our list of place names and find where they occur in a text. To do this, let’s start by reading the file with a list of names.  We’ll use Python’s pathlib library, which offers a simple way to read the text or data in a file. In the following example, we import pathlib and use it to open a file called ‘gazetteer.txt’ and load its text.  We then create a Python list of the place names by splitting on the new line character “\n”. This assumes that your file has a line for each place name.  If you’ve used a different format in your file, you may need to split on the comma “,”, tab ”\t” or pipe “|”. To do this, just change the value inside `.split()` below. 

```python
from pathlib import Path

gazetteer = Path("gazetteer.txt").read_text()
gazetteer = gazetteer.split("\n")
```

At this point, you should be able to `print(gazetteer)` and get a nice list of places:

```python
print(gazetteer) 
```
```
['Armenien', 'Aserbaidshan', 'Aserbaidshen', 'Estland', … ] 
```

## Matching Place Names 
Now that we have a list of place names, let’s find where those terms appear in our texts.  As an example, let’s use this sentence:

```text
Karl-Heinz Quade ist von März 1944 bis August 1948 im Lager 150 in Grjasowez interniert.
```

"Karl-Heinz Quade was interned in Camp 150 in Gryazovets from March 1944 to August 1948." Looking at the text, there’s one place name, [Gryazovets](https://www.openstreetmap.org/search?query=Gryazovets#map=12/58.8695/40.2395), which is a town 450 km from Moscow. We just need to show our computer how to find it (and all the other places we care about). To do this, we'll use spaCy's Matcher tool, which a powerful tool to search the tokenized text for patterns in words and their attributes. 

```python
from spacy.lang.de import German
from spacy.matcher import Matcher

nlp = German()

doc = nlp("Karl-Heinz Quade ist von März 1944 bis August 1948 im Lager 150 in Grjasowez interniert.") 

matcher = Matcher(nlp.vocab)
for place in gazetteer:
    pattern = [{'LOWER': place.lower()}]
    matcher.add(place, [pattern])

matches = matcher(doc)
for match_id, start, end in matches:
    print(start, end, doc[start:end].text)
```
```
13 14 Grjasowez
```
The matcher will find tokens that match the patterns that we’ve given it.  Note that we’ve changed the place names to all lower case letters so that the search will be case-insensitive. Use “ORTH” instead of ”LOWER” if you want case-sensitive search. Note that we get a list of matches that includes what was matched as well as the start and end indexes of the matched spans or tokens. With Matchers, we are able to search for combinations of more than one word such as “New York City” or “Steamboat Springs.” This is really important because you might have “York”, “New York” and “New York City” in your places list. 

If you’ve ever worked with [regular expressions](https://programminghistorian.org/en/lessons/understanding-regular-expressions), some of this should feel familiar. However, rather than matching on sequences of characters, we’re matching token patterns that can also include part of speech and other linguistic attributes of the text.  As an example, let's also match on “Camp 150” (which is “Lager 150” in German). We’ll add a new pattern that will make a match whenever we have “Lager” followed by a number. 

```python
pattern = [{'LOWER': 'lager'},  #the first token should be ‘lager’
           {'LIKE_NUM': True}] # the second token should be a number 

# Add the pattern to the matcher
matcher.add("LAGER_PATTERN", [pattern])
``` 
We now see (start index, end index, match):
```
10 12 Lager 150
13 14 Grjasowez
```

The pattern can be any sequence of tokens and their attributes. For more on how to wield this new superpower, see the [spaCy Matcher documentation](https://spacy.io/api/matcher/), the [spaCy course](https://course.spacy.io) and the [Rule-based Matcher Explorer](https://explosion.ai/demos/matcher). 

## Loading Text Files

In the examples above, we processed a single sentence. That might be all you need, but most often you'll need to process multiple texts at once. The code below will load an entire directory full of txt files. Pathlib gives us an easy way to iterate over all the files in the directory with `iterdir()` as well as a `read_text()` method that will load the text. The code below will list the filename, location and name of every place from our gazetteer that appears in the texts.  

```python 
for file in Path('folder_with_texts_in_it').iterdir():
    doc = nlp(file.read_text())
    matches = matcher(doc)
    for match_id, start, end in matches:
        print(file.name, start, end, doc[start:end].text)
```

## Term Frequency 

At this point you may want to know which items appear most frequently in the text.  To get frequencies, you can use Python’s Counter object. In the following cell, we create an empty list and then add the text for each match. The counter will then return the frequency for each term in the list.   
```python
from collections import Counter

count_list = []
for match_id, start, end in matches:
    count_list.append(doc[start:end].text)

counter = Counter(count_list)

for term, count in counter.most_common(10):
    print(term,count)
```

```
Lager 150 1
Grjasowez 1
```

## Named Entity Recognition 

Up to this point, we have been using the spaCy matcher to search a document for specific place names.  It will find all of the places in our list if they occur in the text.  However, what if we want to find places that are not in the list? What are all the places that appear in the text? For this task, there are pre-trained models for many languages that can identify place names. These are statistical models that have learned the general "look and feel" of a place name and can make predictions.  This means that the model can identify places that were not in its training data. It also means that it can make mistakes. With the jump into machine learning, it's important that you keep in mind that the machine is making informed predictions based on what it has learned. If your materials are significantly different from what the model was trained on, say Ottoman government texts rather than contemporary Turkish newspaper articles, you should expect rather poor performance. It is also possible to fine-tune a model on your materials to improve accuracy.     

To work with a pre-trained model in spaCy, you'll need to download one.  A list of the current options can be found [in the spaCy documentation](https://spacy.io/models).  For our German example, use the command-line interface to download the small model trained on newspaper articles: `python -m spacy download de_core_news_sm`.  To load the model and identify named entities, use the following: 
```python
import spacy 
nlp = spacy.load("de_core_news_sm")

doc = nlp("Karl-Heinz Quade ist von März 1944 bis August 1948 im Lager 150 in Grjasowez interniert.")
for ent in doc.ents:
    print(ent.text, ent.label_, ent.start, ent.end)
```
```
Karl-Heinz Quade PER 0 2
Grjasowez LOC 13 14
```

Just by looking at the text and the relationships between words, the model is able to correctly identify that Karl-Heinz Quade is a person (PER) and that Grjasowez is a place (LOC). Named entity recognition is a powerful tool for finding places, people and organizations in text.  You will encounter machine errors, so it's important to review the results and to correct errors.  With Matcher, you will not get these mistakes, but you also won't find places that are not in the gazetteer. 

## Displacy
To see your results in the context of the text, spaCy includes a useful tool called displacy.  It will  thie an image of the text and the predictions which can be very useful when assessing whether the results will be helpful to your research or introduce too many machine errors to be helpful. spaCy also offers a [web application](https://explosion.ai/demos/displacy-ent) that lets you quickly assess predictions. Visualizations can be created both in Python script or in a running [Jupyter notebook](https://programminghistorian.org/en/lessons/jupyter-notebooks). See the below image for an example visualization produced by displacy.

**python script**
```python 
from spacy import displacy 
displacy.serve(doc, style="ent")
```  


{% include figure.html filename="FINDING-PLACES-WORLD-HISTORICAL-GAZETTEER0.png" caption="Figure 0: entity recognition image" %}


**jupyter notebook**
```python
displacy.render(doc, jupyter=True, style="ent")
```
With statistical models, you can also use displacy to create an useful visualization of the relationships between words in the text. Just use `style='dep'` To generate this visualization. The image below gives an example of the dependency visualization created by displacy. 

```python 
displacy.render(doc, jupyter=True, style="dep")
```  

{% include figure.html filename="FINDING-PLACES-WORLD-HISTORICAL-GAZETTEER1.svg" caption="Figure 1: dependency visualization" %}


Displacy visualizations can also be saved to a file for use elsewhere ([docs](https://spacy.io/usage/visualizers#html)).
```python
from pathlib import Path 

svg = displacy.render(doc, style="dep")
output_path = Path("sentence.svg")
output_path.write_text(svg)
```

## Named Entity Linking

While it's useful to note that Karl-Heinz Quade is a person, it would be even better to know _who_ is Karl-Heinz Quade? Named entity linking is the process of connecting a place or person’s name to a specific record in a knowledge base. This link connects the predicted entity to a unique record and its associated data.  For example, DBpedia records for a place often contain the latitude and longitude, region, country, time zone, population, and other related data. By connecting our text to the DBpedia knowledge base, we are able to utilize external information in our analysis. 

There is a useful Python library for spaCy and the DBpedia spotlight.  This library will attempt to match predicted entities with a record in DBpedia.  This relationship will then be available as part of the entity span. To add this library, enter `pip install spacy-dbpedia-spotlight` in the command line and press enter. 

```python
import spacy
nlp = spacy.load('de_core_news_sm')
nlp.add_pipe('dbpedia_spotlight', config={'language_code': 'de'})

doc = nlp("Karl-Heinz Quade ist von März 1944 bis August 1948 im Lager 150 in Grjasowez interniert.")
for ent in doc.ents:
    print(ent.text, ent.label_, ent.kb_id_)
```
```
Grjasowez DBPEDIA_ENT http://de.dbpedia.org/resource/Grjasowez
interniert DBPEDIA_ENT http://de.dbpedia.org/resource/Internierung
```
Note that we now entites in the document with the "DBPEDIA_ENT" label and the URI for the DBpedia record. Karl-Heinz Quade does not have a page in DBpedia, so we don't get a match, but the Grjasowez record has a wealth of information. To access the data, you can send a request to the dbpedia server. Note that I have replace the human-readable page "resource" with a machine-readable "data". I then add ".json" to the record name, which will return the data as JSON.  I use the requests library to parse the json data and make it ready for use in my Python script. 

```python
import requests
data = requests.get("http://de.dbpedia.org/data/Grjasowez.json").json()
```

You can explore this data with `print(data)` or `data.keys()`. For more on json, see [this *Programming Historian* lesson](https://programminghistorian.org/en/lessons/json-and-jq).
Here is an example of how to access the latitute and longitude this this particular result:
```
data['http://de.dbpedia.org/resource/Grjasowez']['http://www.georss.org/georss/point'][0]['value']
```  
```
'58.88333333333333 40.25'
```  

Before moving on, it is important to note that `spacy-dbpedia-spotlight` is like the Matcher. It takes a predicted entity (a person, place, or organization) and searches DBpedia for a corresponding entry. It can make a match, but it is not able to look at the context of the text to predict whether "I. Ivanov" is the famous Bulgarian badminton player or the Russian skier. spaCy has the capacity to use the surrounding text to disambiguate the results. "Ivan cherished badminton" and "The great skier, Ivanov..." will return different link predictions given the textual context and frequency of the record in the corpus. This is a more involved process that we can detail here. However, one of the developers of spaCy, Sofie Van Landeghem, has recorded [a very useful video on this process](https://spacy.io/universe/project/video-spacy-irl-entity-linking) for those advanced users who require this functionality.   

## Export Our Data

The final step in this section is to export our matches in the [tab separated value (TSV) format required by the World Historical Gazetteer](https://github.com/LinkedPasts/linked-places). If you’ve used a spreadsheet program like Excel or Google Sheets, then you’re familiar with tabular data. This is structured information that has rows and columns. To store tabular data in a simple format, programmers often use tab-separated value (TSV) files. These are simple text files with symbols that split the text into rows and columns. Rows are separated by the new line character `\n`. The row is split into columns by tabs `\t`. 

```python
start_date = "1800" #YYYY-MM-DD
end_date = "2000"
source_title = "Karl-Heinz Quade Diary"

output_text = ""
column_header = "id\ttitle\ttitle_source\tstart\tend\n"  
output_text += column_header  

places_list = []
if matches:
    places_list.extend([ doc[start:end].text for match_id, start, end in matches ])
if doc.ents:
    places_list.extend([ ent.text for ent in doc.ents if ent.label_ == "GPE" or ent.label_ == "LOC"])

# remove duplicate place names by creating a list of names and then converting the list to a set
unique_places = set(places_list)

for id, place in enumerate(unique_places): 
    output_text += f"{id}\t{place}\t{source_title}\t{start_date}\t{end_date}\n"

filename = source_title.lower().replace(' ','_') + '.tsv'
Path(filename).write_text(output_text)
print('created: ', filename)
```

## 6. Uploading to the World Historical Gazetteer
Now that we have a Linked Places TSV, we will upload it to the [World Historical Gazetteer (WHG)](http://whgazetteer.org/). The WHG is a fully web based application. It indexes place references drawn from historical sources, adding temporal depth to a core of approximately 1.8 million modern records. This is especially useful for places whose names have changed over time. By using the WHG, users can upload their data and rapidly find the coordinates of historical places. As mentioned in the gazetteer section above, this service provides automatic geocoding that is suitable for use with historical data. Many common geocoding services such as Google Maps or those behind a paywall barrier such as through ArcGIS are unsuitable for historical research as they are based primarily upon 21st century information. They rarely support historical name information beyond the most common instances. Additionally, the WHG also supports a multitude of languages. Finally, geocoding and basic mapping are achievable through a graphical user interface. This circumnavigates the need to use a script, to trace layers from maps in a different program, or create relational databases and table joins in GIS software.

The WHG is free to use. To get started, register for an account and then sign in. As the image below illustrates, you need to click on the "Register" button located in the top right corner of the homepage. 

{% include figure.html filename="FINDING-PLACES-WORLD-HISTORICAL-GAZETTEER2.JPG" caption="Figure 2: Register" %}


After registering and logging in, you will be taken to the “Datasets” tab. Press “add new” to upload your Linked Pasts TSV to the WHG. The image below shows the placement of the "add new" button on the "Datasets" page.

{% include figure.html filename="FINDING-PLACES-WORLD-HISTORICAL-GAZETTEER3.JPG" caption="Figure 3: Add Data" %}


Insert a title, such as “POW Memoir Places,” and a brief description. Do not check the public box for now, as we do not want this dataset to be visible to anyone by your own user account. You can in the future upload your historic place name information to the WHG if you desire to contribute to the project. Next, browse for you Linked Places TSV and upload it. Do not change the formatting selection. It must remain as Delimited/Spreadsheet. See the below image for a properly formatted upload.

Once the dataset is successfully uploaded, you can begin what is known as the reconciliation process. Back on the “Data” tab, click on the TSV you uploaded. This will take you to a new screen to initially view the dataset’s metadata. Click on the “Reconciliation” tab at the top of this page. Reconciliation is the process of linking your TSV entries to the database of named place entities and their additional relations in the WHG. On the “Reconciliation” tab, press the “add new task” button as illustrated in the image below.

You currently have the option to reconcile your data with Getty TGN or Wikidata. Select Wikidata and press start. If you want to limit the geographical area of your results, apply a geographic constraint filter before pressing start. If none of the pre-defined regions are acceptable, you can create your own user area to fine tune the results given in the reconciliation process. The image below shows the options that you can choose for this process.

After pressing Start, you will be returned to the main “Reconciliation” tab. The process will run for a while and you will receive an email when the process is complete. You can also refresh the screen every few seconds to see if it is done. When it is done, you will be told how many locations need to be reviewed for each pass of the reconciliation process. In this case we will see that of our 133 records, 126 got hits. We now have to do a manual review of the hits to see if they are correct. Press the “Review” button next to "Pass 1" to begin the review. The image below shows how many items there are to review in how many passes. Click where indicated in the image to begin the manual review process.

You will be taken to a new screen that asks you to match your record with records in the WHG. You will be given a choice of potential matches on the right hand side of the screen. Hover over them and they will appear as green flashes on the map illustration screen. Your options are closeMatch or no match. You can only have one closeMatch per place so choose the one from the reconciliation area that best describes your place upload. It is also possible that none of the suggested matches are correct.   

>>> The more information you put into the LP-TSV format, such as country codes, the easier it will be to make these matches. The associated information from the LP-TSV upload will appear on the left hand side of the reconciliation screen to help you understand all of the information provided on the right hand side. If you are building your own dataset, it is worth taking the time to add a country codes (ccodes) column into the file you upload as well as aat type with the corresponding type (e.g. settlement, state, country).

Given the bare bones nature of this upload, it will be a little harder to make these matches. All of the results should come from the countries that made up the Soviet Union: Russia, Ukraine, Belarus, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Moldova, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Georgia, Uzbekistan, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, and Turkmenistan. To see this in action, let's start the reconciliation process. Our first review is for Jelabuga. It is indeed a close match for Yelabuga, which we can tell by a variant of Yelabuga being listed as "Jelabuga@de," confirming that Jelabuga is the German language variant of Yelabuga. We will select "closeMatch" and then "save," which will advance us to the next item for review. Figure 8 below shows where to look for information to determine whether it is a close match or no match. The red box highlights the radio buttons for choosing the type of match as well as the save button to save the choice and advance to the next location for review.

The next location for review is Keller. We can tell that this example is no match because the suggested match is in Italy, as shown in the image below. As our data only concerns places in the USSR, we can save no match and quickly move on. Note that if you realize you made a mistake, you can go back one previous save by pressing the "Undo last save" button on the top left of the Reconciliation Review" screen.

{% include figure.html filename="FINDING-PLACES-WORLD-HISTORICAL-GAZETTEER9.JPG" caption="Figure 9: No Match" %}


Go ahead an finish the review of the remaining 23 records for Pass 1. As a hint, out of the 25 places for Pass 1 reconciliation, only Yelabuga, Kupjansk, Atkarsk, Makejewka, Kokand, Selenodolsk, Merefa, Usa [Belarus], Wjasma, Fastow,and Owrutsch are close matches.

Once you complete review of Pass 1, you are automatically taken to complete review of Pass 2. For now, go back to the Data button on the top right corner of the screen to return to your data tab. Click on your "POW Memoir Places" dataset again to go to its metadata page. If you click on the "Browse" tab next to the "Metadata" tab, you will now see that there are geometries for the places we decided were close matches. These places now appear on the map preview, as illustrated in the image below.

If you click on the "Reconciliation" tab again, you can click on review next two Pass 2 to keep reviewing locations. If you wish, you can complete going through the 101 locations for Pass 2. Should you complete the review process, you will get a map that looks like the one below.

If you wish to download an image file of the map, you can do so by hovering over the download symbol in the top left corner of the map preview and then sliding your mouse over to the arrows that appear showing "download current size." The red box in the image below highlights a download button. Click on the download symbol to save an image file of the map generated by the WHG.

## 7. Future Mapping Work and Suggested Further Lessons
The reconciliation process will not only give you a static map, but it was also give you an augmented dataset to download. This augmented file will include the latitude and longitude coordinates for your close matches. You can download the augmented file from the dataset's Metadata tab. In th bottom right hand corner, there is a box that says "Downloads" and you can choose either the Linked Placed format GeoJSON file or a TSV. The red box in the image below shows where to click to donwload the augmented dataset in either of the two formats.

{% include figure.html filename="FINDING-PLACES-WORLD-HISTORICAL-GAZETTEER13.JPG" caption="Figure 13: Augmented Data" %}


You can then use the augmented dataset in desktop or web-based mapping applications such as [QGIS](https://www.qgis.org/en/site/) or [ArcGIS Online](https://www.arcgis.com/index.html) to undertake more advanced geographic information system (GIS) spatial analysis. In these programs, you can change the map visualizations, perform analysis, or make a multimedia web mapping project. We highly suggest you look at the additional Programming Historian mapping lessons on [Installing QGIS and Adding Layers](https://programminghistorian.org/en/lessons/qgis-layers) as well as [Creating Vector Layers in QGIS](https://programminghistorian.org/en/lessons/vector-layers-qgis) to see how you can use the results of this lesson to carry out further analysis.
